i also recognize a huge gap between south and north koreans.
"we are all koreans, but have become very different as a result of 67 years of division."
i went through a crisis of my own origin.
am i south korean or north korean?
where do i come from? and who am i?
"suddenly, i didn't have a country i could proudly call my country."
although adjusting to life in south korea is not easy at all i have made a plan.
and start studying to get ready for college entrance exams.
"however, as soon as i got used to my life here, i got the terrible news."
"north korean authorities discovered the money i had sent to my family, and, as punishment, they would force my family to move back to a rural quarantined area."
"so that they could get out of there quickly, i started making plans to help my family escape."
the north koreans had to overcome seemingly unimaginable distances to get to freedom.
"because crossing the border from north to south korea was almost impossible, so i had to fly to china and then back toward the north korean border."
"because my family doesn't speak chinese, i had to travel with them for 2,000 miles in china and then southeast asia."
"the journey by bus took about a week, and on several occasions we almost got caught."
"one time, our car was stopped and searched by a chinese police officer."
"he took everybody's id, and he started asking questions."
"because my family did not understand chinese, i thought they would be arrested."
"as the chinese policeman approached them, i was immediately on my feet and told him that these were deaf mute people i was having to go with."
"he looked at me doubtfully, but thankfully he took my word for it."
"and we kept going all the way to the border of laos, but i had to use almost all the money i had to bribe the border guards in laos."
"however, after we made it across the border, my family was put in jail again for illegal border crossing."
"after i paid the fine and bribed, my family was released for a month, then arrested again in the capital of laos."
it was the most desperate time of my life.
"i did everything i could to get my family to freedom, and we almost succeeded, but they were arrested, and we were a short distance away from the korean embassy."
"i walked back and forth between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to get my family out of there, but i didn't have enough money to bribe or pay the fines anymore."
i was absolutely desperate.
"at that moment, a man asked me, ""what's going on?"""
it amazes me how a complete stranger could care so much to ask me that.
"with my little english and a dictionary, i told him about my family's plight, and without hesitation, the man went to the atm, and he paid all the money that was missing for both my family and two other north koreans to get out of jail."
"i thanked him with all my heart, and i also asked him, ""why are you helping me?"""
"i'm not helping you, he answered."
i'm helping the north koreans.
i realized that it was a moment of enormous significance in my life.
"the kindness of the stranger became a new symbol of hope for me and for the people of north korea when we desperately needed it, and he showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are the glimmers of hope that we north koreans are looking for."
"finally, after a long journey my family and i were reunited in south korea, but getting to freedom was only half the struggle."
"a lot of north koreans are being separated from their families, and when they reach another country, they have to start from scratch with little or almost no money."
"so we can get support from the international community for education, for english language training, for vocational training, for many other areas."
"we can also serve as a bridge between those who are in north korea and the outside world, because there are many of us who are in touch with other family members in the country, and we share with them information and money to be able to change north korea from the inside out."
"i have been extremely fortunate to have received so much help and inspiration throughout my life, so i wish i too could join forces to give my country a chance to grow along with international support."
"i'm confident that you'll see more and more north koreans succeeding everywhere in the world, including on the ted stage."
thank you.
i only have one request today.
please don't tell me i'm normal.
now i want to introduce you to my brothers.
"remi is 22, tall and very handsome,"
"i can't speak, but i communicate joy in a way that even some of the best orators can't."
remi knows what love is.
"you share it unconditionally no matter what, no matter what."
she's not greedy. she doesn't know her skin color.
"he doesn't care about religious differences, and understand this: he's never lied."
"when she sang songs from our childhood, trying to remember words that even i couldn't, she reminded me of one thing: how little we know about the brain, and how great we don't know yet."
samuel was 16. i'm a tall man. i'm very handsome too.
i have a perfect memory.
but it's also selective.
"she doesn't remember if she swiped my chocolate bar, but she does remember the year of each song's release on my ipod, the conversations we had between her as a four-year-old, peeing on my hand the day the teletubbies aired the first episode, and lady gaga's birthday."
"this all sounds so great, doesn't it?"
but most people don't agree.
"and the fact is that because my children's minds don't fit into the normal social model, they are often ignored and misunderstood."
"but what made my heart feel better and my soul stronger was that, even though this was true, even though they weren't considered normal, this could only mean one thing: they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary."
"for those of you who aren't familiar with the term ""autism,"" it's a brain complex disorder that affects our ability to communicate socially, academically and sometimes physically."
"the disease symptom in each individual is different, which is why remi is so different from sam."
"and worldwide, one more person is diagnosed with autism every 20 minutes, and even though it's one of the fastest-growing developmental disorders in the world, we don't know the cause or the cure."
"and i can't remember the first time i had access to autism, but i can't remember a day without it."
i was three years old when my brother was born and i was so excited that there was a new person in my life.
"and after a few months, i realized that he was different."
you scream a lot.
"he didn't want to play like any other baby, and in fact, he didn't seem interested in me or anything."
"remi lives and reigns in her own world, with her own rules, and she sees joy in the smallest things, like stacking cars around the room and staring at the washing machine and eating whatever is within reach."
"as he grew up, he became more and more different, and the differences became more clear."
"but beyond the anger and the frustration and the restless hyperactivity is something truly unique: a pure and innocent instinct, a boy who sees life without prejudice, a man who never lies."
extraordinary.
"well, i can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments i wish they were just like me."
"but i brought my memories back to what they had taught me about character and communication and love, and i realized that these are things that i wouldn't trade for normalcy."
normal misses the beauty that our differences give us and that we're different doesn't mean that one of us is wrong.
it just means there's another kind of'right '.
"and if i can only communicate one thing to remi and to sam and to you, it's that you don't have to be normal."
you can be extraordinary.
"because autistic or not, the difference between us -- we have a gift! everyone has a gift inside of us, and to be honest, the pursuit of normalcy is the ultimate sacrifice of potential."
"the opportunity for greatness, for progress and for change is extinguished when we try to be like someone else."
please -- don't tell me i'm normal.
thank you.
you may all agree with me that this is a very beautiful road.
"it's built out of asphalt, and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on, but that's not always the case, especially not on these days when it's raining a lot."
then you might get splashed on the street with water.
"and especially if you ride your bike, and get past these cars, it's not cool."
"also, the asphalt makes a lot of noise."
"it's a noisy material, and if we make roads like the netherlands, very close to cities, we want a quiet road."
the solution to the problem is to make roads out of porous asphalt.
"the spongy asphalt is the material we currently use to build most of the national highways in the netherlands, it has holes and water just seeped through the wood. so all the rainwater will drain out all the way, and you'll have a convenient road to drive in. so no more splashes."
and the noise also disappears through the seepage.
"because it's so hollow, all the noise will disappear, so the road is very quiet."
"there are, of course, many inconveniences, and the inconvenience of this type of sugar is that cracks and flakes can occur."
what is a rupture? you see there in this road that is peeling off the face.
"first you get a rock, then more, then more, more, more, more, and then they -- well, i'm not going to do that."
but they can damage your car windows. so you're not happy with that.
"and eventually, this kind of rupture will cause more and more damage."
sometimes they make potholes.
"well, he's getting ready."
"potholes, of course, can become a problem, but we have a solution."
"as a matter of fact, as you can see here, this material shows signs of damage."
"it's a porous plastic, and like i said, you only get a small amount of adhesive between the stones."
"under weather conditions, solar radiation, this plastic oxidation state, this bitumen resin, the glue between these aggregates will shrink, and if it shrinks, it will have tiny cracks, and then it will tear away from the aggregates."
"and then if you drive up to that road, you're going to destroy these clumps -- as we just saw here."
"to solve this problem, we've made materials that heal themselves."
"if we can create this self-healing material, then we can come up with solutions."
"so what we can do is we can use steel wool to clean the saucepans, and we can cut the steel wool really small, and we mix these little bits and pieces with bitumen."
so we have asphalt mixed with very small pieces of steel.
"and then you need a machine that, as you can see here, is a cooking machine -- a magnetic induction machine."
"magnetic induction can generate heat, especially steel, which conducts heat very well."
"what you do is you heat up the steel, you melt the bitumen, and the bitumen will flow into these micro-cracks, and the stones will stick to the surface again."
i use a microwave today because i can't bring a bulky magnetic sensor to the stage.
microwave ovens have the same operating system.
"i put the specimen in the oven, and now i'm going to take it out and check it out."
this is the specimen that was taken out.
i said we invented an industrial machine like this in the lab to heat up the samples.
"at the lab we tested a lot of samples, and then the government, they actually saw the results, and they said, ""well, that's a good way. we have to try it."""
"and then they gave us a 400-meter-long section of highway a58, where we had to build a new material test road."
"so that's what we've done here. you see the experimental path we've taken, and then of course this path will last for years without any damage. that's what we learned from the experiment."
we took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab.
"so we aged the samples, we put loads on it, we glued them together with a magnetic sensor, we patched them together and we tested them again."
we can do it over and over again like that.
"and in fact, the conclusion from this research is that if we maintain the road every four years with a welding machine -- this is the big version we built to maintain the real road -- if we maintain the road every four years, then we can double the surface life of the road, which of course saves a lot of money."
"well, to summarize, i can say that we've created a material that uses steel fibers, in addition to steel fibers, using magnetic heat, to actually increase the longevity of the road, double the longevity of the road surface, which even you can do, doubling the longevity of the road using very simple tricks, which saves a lot of money."
now you're probably wondering whether this is going to work or not.
we have a specimen here. it's quite warm.
i should have let it cool down first before i showed you the effect of healing.
but let me try.
"look at that. yeah, it's sticky."
thank you.
i'm here today to talk about a perplexing question whose answer is equally perplexing.
"the topic is the secret of domestic violence, and the question i ask is the one that people always ask: why did she stay?"
why should the woman stay with the person who beat them?
"i am not a psychiatrist, i am not a social worker or an expert in domestic violence."
i'm just a woman who wants to share her story.
"i was 22 years old, fresh out of harvard college."
i moved to new york city when i did my first job writing and editing for seventeen magazine.
"the first time i had my own apartment, my own american express credit card, and i had a big secret."
"the secret is, this gun is loaded with hollow-point cartridges pointed at my head by the man i thought was my mate, over and over again."
the man i loved more than anyone put a gun to my head and threatened to kill me so many times that i can't even remember him.
"i'm here to tell you about crazy love, a psychological trap disguised under the guise of love that millions of women and even some men have every year."
this could be your story.
i don't look like a domestic violence consultant.
"i have a bachelor's degree in english from harvard college, and marketing business administration from the wharton business school."
"i've spent most of my career working for american top 500 companies like johnson & johnson, leo burnett and the washington times."
i have been married to my second husband for almost 20 years and have three children together.
"my dog is like black lab, and i drive a honda odyssey minivan."
"so the first thing i want to tell you is that domestic violence happens to everyone, all genders, all religions, all income and education levels."
it happens everywhere.
"and the second thing i want to say is that people think domestic violence happens to women, and that's a women's problem."
that's not true.
"more than 85 percent of abusers are men, and domestic violence happens only in close, committed, long-term relationships, in other words, in families, the last place we want or expect to find violence, and that's one reason domestic abuse is so confusing."
"i told myself, i'm the other person on earth who lives with the man who beat me, but in fact, i'm a typical victim due to my age."
"i'm only 22 years old, and in the united states, women between 16 and 24 are three times more likely to become victims of domestic violence than women of other ages, and over 500 women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners, boyfriends, and husbands in the united states."
"i was a typical victim, too, because i knew nothing about domestic violence, or its warning signs or patterns."
"i met conor one night in january, rain and cold."
"he was sitting next to me in the new york city tunnel, and he started talking to me."
he told me about two things.
"one was that he, like me, had just graduated from ivy league school and that he worked at a very impressive wall street bank."
but what struck me the most at the first meeting was that he was smart and funny and he looked like a farm boy.
"he had mounds that were this big, big apple-shaped cheekbones and hair that gleamed like golden rice paddies and he seemed very sweet."
"one of the smartest things conor did, from the very beginning, was create the illusion that i was a promising partner."
he did this particular thing in the beginning by worshipping me.
"we started dating, and he loved me for all intents and purposes, that i was smart, that i chose to go to harvard, that i was passionate about helping teenage girls and their jobs."
"he wanted to know everything about my family and about my childhood, my hopes and dreams."
"conor trusts me, as a writer and a woman in a way that no one has ever had."
"and he also created this magical atmosphere of trust between us by confessing his secrets, that he, as a child from the age of four, had been brutally and repeatedly physically abused by his stepfather, and the abuse worsened and he left school at the age of eight, even though he was brilliant and it took him almost 20 years to rebuild his life."
that explains why the degree at ivy leage and the wall street job and his bright future mean so much to him.
"if you tell me that this smart, funny, sensitive man who adored me one day dictate whether or not i was made up, how short my skirt was, where i lived, what jobs i did, who my friends were and where i spent christmas, i would laugh at you because there was no trace of violence or control or anger in conor from the beginning."
i didn't know that the first phase of any domestic violence relationship is to seduce and seduce the victim.
i also didn't know that the second phase was to isolate the victim.
"now, conor didn't come home one day and say, ""hey, you know, all this romeo and juliet stuff is great, but i need to move on to the next phase where i isolate and torture you"" â€” â€” ""so i need to get you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear you scream and out of this city where you have friends and family and co-workers who can see the bruises."""
"instead, conor came home on a friday night and he told me that he was quitting his job today, his dream job, and he said, he quit his job because of me, because i made him feel so safe and loved that he didn't need to prove himself on wall street anymore, and he just wanted to get out of the city, away from his dysfunctional and abusive family, and go to a small town in new england where he could start his life over with me."
"now, the last thing i wanted to do was leave new york and my dream job, but i thought you had to sacrifice for your partner, so i agreed and quit my job, and conor and i left manhattan together."
"i had no idea that i was falling for crazy love, that i was taking my first steps into a carefully orchestrated psychological, monetary and physical trap."
the next step in this violent scenario is to put in the threat of violence and see how she reacts.
"from here, the guns come in."
"when we moved to new england -- you know, the place that conor relied on to feel safe -- he bought three guns."
he kept a tree in the glove compartment of our car.
"one under the pillow by our bedside, the third he kept in his wallet."
and he said that he needed these guns because of the trauma you have experienced in the past as a child.
he needs them to feel protected.
"but these guns were actually a message to me, and even though he hadn't put his arm around me yet, my life was in danger every minute of every day."
conor attacked me five days before our wedding.
it was 7: 00 in the morning when i was in my nightgown.
"i was working on the roof, trying to wilt into the post i was assigned, and i was frustrated, conor using my anger as an excuse to put his hands around my neck and tighten them so tightly that i couldn't breathe or scream, and he slammed my head against the wall with his elbows repeatedly."
"five days later, ten bruises on my neck came out clearly, and i put on my mother's wedding dress, and i married him."
"despite everything that's happened, i'm sure we'll live happily ever after because i love him and he loves me so much, too."
and he was deeply apologetic.
he was really stressed out about the wedding and the marriage with me.
"it was an isolated incident, and he would never hurt me again."
it happened twice more on our honeymoon.
"for the first time, i was driving to find a secret beach and i got lost, and he hit me on the side of the head so hard that my head kept banging against the window of the car."
"a few days later, as he was driving home from his honeymoon, he was tired of traffic, and he threw a whole bag of big mac food in my face."
conor went on to beat me once or twice a week for the next two months and half a year after i got married.
i was wrong to think that i was the only one and i was alone in this.
"a third of american women experience domestic violence or stalking at some stage of their lives and the cdc report shows 15 million children are abused every year, 15 million."
"so, i was really good at the company."
back to my question: why did i stay?
the answer is easy.
i didn't know he was abusing me.
"even as he held a gun to my head, pushed me to the floor, threatened to kill my dogs, pulled the keys out of the car as i drove down the highway dumping coffee grinds on my head as i dressed for the interview, i never once thought of myself as a tortured wife."
